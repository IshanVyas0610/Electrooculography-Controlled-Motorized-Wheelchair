# Electrooculography Controlled Motorized Wheelchair

This project aims to develop a cost-effective smart wheelchair that utilizes eye blinks and eye signals for control, providing mobility assistance to individuals with severe physical disabilities and neurological disorders. The wheelchair incorporates an Arduino UNO ATmega 328P controller and an AD8232 ECG module for data acquisition. By using electrooculography (EOG), the system allows patients who cannot use other biological signals like EEG or EMG to independently operate the wheelchair. The main objectives of this project are:

- Create a wheelchair system that restores autonomy to patients with neurological disorders.
- Enable individuals with severe disabilities to move freely without relying heavily on caregivers.
- Utilize eye blinks and eye signals as control inputs for the wheelchair.
- Develop a low-cost solution using the Arduino UNO ATmega 328P and AD8232 ECG module.
- Ensure accessibility to a wider range of patients, including those with paraplegia, quadriplegia, ALS, late-stage spastic diplegic cerebral palsy, and Duchene muscular dystrophy (without ocular involvement).
